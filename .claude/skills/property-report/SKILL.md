# Property Report Generator

Analyse a UK residential property or area and produce a grounded investment report: comps, EPC, rental, yield, stamp duty, market context, and a BUY/WATCH/PASS verdict.

You compose real data (Land Registry, EPC register, Rightmove) via the BOUCH property MCP, then hand the aggregated data to deterministic Python scripts for normalisation, yield maths, underwriting, and rendering. This keeps the numbers right and the output consistent.

## When to use

- "What's this property worth?" / "Analyse 14 Elm Street, NG1 5BT"
- "Are these comps for SW2 reasonable?"
- "Is this a good rental investment?"
- "Pull me a property report" / "Give me a property snapshot"
- Any request involving UK property valuation, comparison, or investment analysis

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Mortgage advice or affordability calculations
- Structural / surveyor work
- Legal advice on purchase
- Predicting future prices

## Setup — connect the MCP once

This skill depends on a UK property MCP server being connected. Two options, depending on how the user installed this skill.

**Option 1 — Plugin (recommended, bundles the MCP):**

```
/plugin marketplace add paulieb89/bouch-plugins
/plugin install foundations@bouch-plugins
```

Installs this skill plus nine others and pre-wires the Ledgerhall MCP gateway (`uk-business-mcp.fly.dev`), which fronts property, legal, and due-diligence data.

**Option 2 — MCP direct (standalone install):**

If the user installed this skill via `npx skills add paulieb89/bouch-mcp-skills` or git clone, they need to add the MCP manually:

```
claude mcp add --transport http property https://property-shared.fly.dev/mcp
```

For claude.ai and Claude Desktop, paste the same URL under Settings → MCP Servers. No API key. Free, hosted.

## Preflight — verify the MCP is live

Before running the workflow, call `property_comps` with a throwaway postcode (e.g. `SW1A 1AA`). If it returns a tool-not-found error or connection error:

1. Stop. Don't try to improvise.
2. Tell the user the property MCP isn't connected.
3. Show them Option 1 or Option 2 above depending on whether they're on Claude Code with plugin support.
4. Ask them to reconnect and retry.

If `property_comps` returns data (even empty results), proceed to the lane-selection step.

## Pick a lane first

Before calling any tool, decide which lane the query fits. Don't chain every tool by default.

**Lane A — Specific property** ("what's 14 Elm St worth?", any named street address)
- Tools: `property_comps` → `property_epc` → `rental_analysis` → `rightmove_search` → `property_yield` → `stamp_duty`
- Output: full report rendered from `assets/report-template.md`

**Lane B — Area investment scan** ("should I buy in NG11 9HD?", postcode-only investment queries)
- Tools: `property_comps` (no address — EPC-enriched) → `rental_analysis` → `property_yield`
- Skip: `property_epc` (comps already carry it), `stamp_duty` unless the user gives a budget
- Output: area overview in prose, not the full template

**Lane C — Quick stat** ("typical prices in NG11 9HD?", one-shot questions)
- Tools: `property_comps` only
- Output: 2-3 sentence answer with inline stats. No template, no verdict.

Default to Lane B for vague postcode queries. Lane A needs a street address.

## Workflow (Lane A — the full report)

### Step 1 — Gather

Call the MCP tools in this order, in parallel where dependencies allow:

1. `property_comps` with the postcode (and `property_type` filter if the area has mixed stock: F=flat, D=detached, S=semi, T=terraced). Extract median price — this feeds later steps.
2. `property_epc` with the street address (subject property detail: current + potential rating, floor area, annual costs).
3. `rental_analysis` with the postcode AND `purchase_price=<median from Step 1>` to populate gross yield.
4. `rightmove_search` with `channel=RENT` for actual listings (rental_analysis aggregates can be misleading — see `references/rental-normalisation.md`).
5. `property_yield` with the postcode (same `property_type` filter as Step 1 if used).
6. `stamp_duty` with the median price. If primary residence not specified, compute both (additional_property=true and =false).
7. `rightmove_search` with `channel=BUY` for current-market context.

Collect all responses into a single JSON object keyed by tool name. Save to `/tmp/property-report-raw.json`.

### Step 2 — Normalise

Run the rental normaliser:

```bash
python scripts/normalise_rents.py --input /tmp/property-report-raw.json --output /tmp/property-report-rental.json
```

This converts weekly rents to monthly, separates student from professional lets, and flags if the market is dominated by one segment. Read `references/rental-normalisation.md` if you need to understand why this matters.

### Step 3 — Yield

```bash
python scripts/compute_yield.py --input /tmp/property-report-raw.json --rental /tmp/property-report-rental.json --output /tmp/property-report-yield.json
```

Returns gross yield, net yield (after 30% cost allowance), and comparison against the property_yield tool's own output. If they diverge materially, both are reported.

### Step 4 — Underwrite

```bash
python scripts/underwrite.py --input /tmp/property-report-raw.json --yield /tmp/property-report-yield.json --criteria assets/underwriting-defaults.json --output /tmp/property-report-verdict.json
```

Returns `{decision: BUY|WATCH|PASS, score, reasons[]}`. The defaults in `assets/underwriting-defaults.json` are for a standard UK BTL investor. To apply a client's own criteria, copy the JSON, edit thresholds, and pass it via `--criteria`.

### Step 5 — Render

```bash
python scripts/render_report.py --raw /tmp/property-report-raw.json --rental /tmp/property-report-rental.json --yield /tmp/property-report-yield.json --verdict /tmp/property-report-verdict.json --template assets/report-template.md --output /tmp/property-report.md
```

Read the resulting markdown, sanity-check for obvious data issues (see Step 6), then present it to the user.

### Step 6 — Sanity check

Before presenting, spot-check:
- EPC floor area vs listing size (if mismatched, flag — see `references/epc-nuance.md`)
- Comp transaction count (<5 = thin market, say so)
- Rental sample — if student lets dominate, say professional-let yield may not apply
- Stamp duty — is the user a first-time buyer, primary-residence buyer, or additional-property buyer? If unspecified, show both.

### Step 7 — Present + offer save

Present the rendered report. End with:

> Want me to save this to a Google Sheet or draft an email with the summary?

If yes, use the Strata server actions (sheets + gmail) to persist. Do not save without asking.

## Workflow (Lane B — area scan)

Skip `property_epc`, `stamp_duty`, and the full render. Do Steps 1 (subset), 2, 3. Present as prose, emphasise yield and market context. Offer Step 7 only if the user seems serious about the area.

## Workflow (Lane C — quick stat)

One MCP call, one inline answer. Example: "Median sale price in NG11 9HD over the last 24 months is £182k across 38 transactions. Mostly 3-bed semis (EPC D typical)."

## Flat-specific extras (optional)

For leasehold flats, three extra MCP tools are useful:
- `property_blocks` — other units trading in the same building
- `company_search` — freeholder / management company on Companies House
- `planning_search` — nearby development affecting value or views

Only call these if the property is a flat AND the context warrants it.

## Output rules

- British spelling (analyse, colour, organised)
- £245,000 not 245000; round yields to 1dp
- Always state data source + date range for comps
- If data is missing, say so — do not guess
- Do not speculate on future prices
- Always include the disclaimer: data analysis, not professional valuation advice

- `scripts/underwrite.py` — BUY/WATCH/PASS against criteria JSON
- `scripts/render_report.py` — fills the template with all gathered data

- `references/rental-normalisation.md` — why rental_analysis can mislead

## What this skill does NOT do

- Mortgage advice or affordability
- RICS-grade valuation
- Legal conveyancing advice
- Structural condition
- Future price prediction

Always include: *this is data analysis, not professional valuation advice*.
